        When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. Yeah,
        alright, bye-bye. What? Perfect, just perfect. Can I go now, Mr.
        Strickland? Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple
        underwear before, Calvin.
      </p>
      <p>
        I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I
        don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know
        how to do it. George. George. Weight has nothing to do with it. I
        know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. I can't believe you loaned me
        a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you.
        You okay, is everything alright? Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon.
        I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play
        in front of anybody. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of
        your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your
        brother.
      </p>

        Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair.
        Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring
        an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning
        struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill
        Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the
        way it is as part of our history and heritage. Biff. I will. Oh.
